# C4 System Containers

## C4 System Container Diagram
A container is considered a single deployable unit, not to be confused with a Docker container. An example would be a Java app and a Postgres DB. Slightly more technical than a system context diagram and provides a more 'zoomed in' description of a system.

## Listings Example
* A mobile app for mobile users
* A web app that serves web browsers and also hosts an API for the mobile app to retrieve and send data to and from
* A Redis instance for caching, to prevent repeated API calls to downstream services, such as the title service
* Kafka message broker, that receives domain events (user views listing, user watches title) Note: Won't be on this diagram

### Flowchart
This diagram also uses a top-down flowchart style.

  class WA,MA container
```

### Subgraphs
The boundary of the system can be highlighted with a subgraph so it's more clear. For C4 diagrams, they're meant to differentiate system's containers, within a boundary, from the rest of the nodes.
Additionally, different shapes can be used to differentiate a regular node from a datastore.

**Example - Subgraph**

```
subgraph listing-service[Listing Service]
  MA-- "Makes API calls to\n[HTTPS]" -->WA
  WA-- "Reads and writes to\n[Redis]" -->R
end
```

**Example - Shape Change**

```
R[("In-Memory Cache")]
Circle[(("This creates a circle))]
Diamond[{"This creates a diamond"}]
```

### Adding Supporting Services / Link Lengths
Displaying additional services that a workflow relies on but won't require additional work themselves. Mermaid automatically ranks nodes based on definitions, such as person and app. Child nodes always sit below parents. Rank can be manually adjusted to ensure systems fall below other systems when needed.

**Example**
The following will display the supporting services at the same level as Redis:
```
  WA-- "Makes API calls to\n[HTTPS]" -->TS
```
A slight modification to the hyphen on the last arrow will push it to the next level:
```
  WA-- "Makes API calls to\n[HTTPS]" --->TS
```

### Displaying Async Interactions
Interactions between an application and message broker will always be asynchronous, and this can be notated by displaying a dotted line instead of a solid one.

```
ParentNode-. "arrow text" .->ChildNode
```

**Example**

Regular synchronous line:
```
WA-- "Publishes messages to\n[Binary over TCP]" --->K
```

Dotted aync line:
```
WA-. "Publishes messages to\n[Binary over TCP]" ..->K
```
