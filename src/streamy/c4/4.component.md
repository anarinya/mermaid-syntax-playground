# C4 System Components

## C4 System Component Diagram
Equivalent of a high-level namespace or module, or some sort of library or package that's included in a container. Should provide the major building blocks of each container. This diagram is optional, since it's difficult to keep up-to-date with how quickly it can change.

There's more value in adding component diagrams for larger systems, such as modular monoliths where high-level components map to domains.

For granular microservices, component diagrams are wasted effort, since the majority of useful information can be provided via a container diagram.
