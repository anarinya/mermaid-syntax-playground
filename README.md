# Mermaid Syntax Playground

Mermaid syntax is a way to create charts and diagrams with markdown, instead of having to manually draw them out using some kind of graphics tool. It's 1000x faster, can be modified on the fly during discussions, easier to embed and share, and quick to learn.

```mermaid

Mermaid["Diagrams"]
Something["???"]
Profit["Profit!"]

Mermaid-->Something-->Profit
```

Seriously though...

```mermaid

M["[Architecture Diagrams]

  Create while collaborating
  on solutions or when attempting
  to understand user flows."]

R["[Shared Understanding]

  something instead of expecting
  others to read walls of text.
